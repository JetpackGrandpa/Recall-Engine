# Recall-Engine


---To Get Started---

This is a Browser Extension/Plugin for YouTube. Upload this .zip folder as a "Load Unpacked" file for testing, as it is not yet launched on the Microsoft Web store. Be sure to turn on Dev mode on your Browser.


---General Description---

The frustration of losing a video in a YouTube playlist is often silenced by even frustrating restrictions. Though you can't retrieve that forever, the Recall Engine at least helps you know what you lost and fetch an alternate. 
To all pseudo-owners who think what enters your playlist is entirely yours, here comes the Recall Engine.


---How To Make it Recall---

- Unlist or Make Public your playlist
- Paste its link
- Forget*
- Come back to know what went poof

(starred steps are mandatory)
